## About the Video Course
With MEAN, we can now build an application that is completely written on JavaScript technologies from front end to backend and also at database level. Dive deeper into MEAN Stack by building 3 real world projects. You will cover the core topics of end-to-end Web Application development with MongoDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS 

The goal of this series is to make you well verse with MEAN stack development. You will go through three different and real-world projects. Get a broader understanding on the applications of MEAN and  build beautiful applications.

By the end of the course, you will be a confident MEAN stack developer.
